# E-Commerce Project README

## Overview
This is an e-commerce project built using Laravel, which allows administrators to manage categories, subcategories, products (with multiple images), and product stock. Users can browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. The project utilizes repository and service layer patterns, custom role-based validation, Laravel's ORM relations, eager loading, and various frontend technologies to enhance the user interface.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Admins can add new products with detailed information and multiple images. They can also edit and delete products.
- **Stock Management**: The system links product IDs with color, size, and quantity, allowing for efficient stock management.
- **Custom Role-based Validation**: Custom validation rules are applied based on user roles to ensure data integrity.
